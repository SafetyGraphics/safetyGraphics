<h1> <b> Welcome to the Safety Graphics Shiny App </b> </h1>
<p>
    The Safety Graphics Shiny app is an interactive tool for evaluating clinical trial safety using a flexible data pipeline.
    This application and corresponding <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/safetyGraphics/index.html">{safetyGraphics}</a> R package have been developed as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://safetygraphics.github.io/">Interactive Safety Graphics (ISG) workstream</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://community.amstat.org/biop/workinggroups/safety/safety-home">ASA Biopharm-DIA Safety Working Group</a>.
</p>

<h3><i> Using the app</i></h3>
<p>
    Detailed instructions about using the app can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics/wiki/Intro">vignette</a>.
    In short, the user will initialize the app with their data, adjust settings as needed, and view the interactive charts.
    Finally, the user may export a self-contained, fully reproducible snapshot of the charts that can be easily shared with others.
</p>

<h3><i> Charts </i></h3>
<p>
    The app is built to support a wide variety of chart types including static plots (e.g. from <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">{ggplot2}</a>), shiny modules, <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmlwidgets/index.html">{htmlwidgets}</a> and even static outputs like RTFs.
    Several pre-configured charts are included in the companion <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/safetyGraphics/safetyCharts">{safetyCharts}</a> R Package, and are available by default in the app.
    Other charts can be added using the process descibed in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyGraphics/wiki/ChartConfiguration">this vignette</a>.
