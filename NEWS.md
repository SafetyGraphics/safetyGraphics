# safetyGraphics v2.1.1

Resolves a bug that was causing unexpected data filters on initial load. 

# safetyGraphics v2.1.0

This release focuses on updates the safetyGraphics metadata framework:

- The default metadata table has been migrated to safetyCharts and modularized. In short,`safetyGraphics::meta` is now saved as `safetyCharts::meta_aes`, `safetyCharts::meta_labs` and `safetyCharts::meta_dm`.
- A new `makeMeta` function has been created and integrated in to the default workflow for the Shiny app. `makeMeta` provides a much more flexible framework for creating and storing metadata. See `?makeMeta` and the Cookbook and Chart Configuration vignettes for more details.
